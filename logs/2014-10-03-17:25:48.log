 The two-person vanguard "Galactic Exterminator" is located at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.
l
 ["Golactic Speedy" Control Room]
 The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the
front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches,
and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has
been silenced by the lack of power, creating an eerie silence. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly
enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.
 You can go south and out.
peer out
 You peer out and see...
 [Alliance High Guard Command; Garage]
 This cavernous starship garage echoes with the sound of metal upon metal as starships are constantly transported to and from one of the four docking
bays. Narrow metal staircases wend their way up the sides of the dome to catwalks which provide access to those starships kept in long-term storage
near the ceiling. Recharging platforms create a maze of twisting pathways and dead end corridors throughout the garage, and silvery drones rush around
tending to the various spacecraft. Four wide archways provide access to the promenades on this level, and at the center of the room, a small carpeted
platform leads down to the main level of the spaceport.

 [Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Beta]
 Situated on the uppermost level of the spaceport, this enormous docking bay is open to the sky above. A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the
entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols
between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the west looms the enormous gleaming steel
dome of the starship garage. An enormous letter B has been painted on its eastern face. Wide walkways slant off to the northwest and southwest. An
open doorway leads into an enormous steel building to the east.
 You see the four-person roborant "Hokus Pokus", the eight-person gunship "Blitzkrieg", and the one-person fighter "Soaring Eagle" landed here.
 You see Jeffery the droid, Bee the droid, Brita the droid, Bodil the droid, Baba the droid, and Cassy the droid here.
