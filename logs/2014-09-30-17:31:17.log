 Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row
of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft
beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The room is bathed in dull blue light emanating from the wormhole
outside. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a thin layer of marble. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status.
Looking through the black tinted window, you see the ship is traveling through a jumpgate.
 You see a low gold leather wing-backed chair, a large tinkling dark gold marble floor fountain with tiny silver and gold fish swimming in its water,

of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft
beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light

 [Alliance High Guard Command; Garage]
 This cavernous starship garage echoes with the sound of metal upon metal as starships are constantly transported to and from one of the four docking
bays. Narrow metal staircases wend their way up the sides of the dome to catwalks which provide access to those starships kept in long-term storage
near the ceiling. Recharging platforms create a maze of twisting pathways and dead end corridors throughout the garage, and silvery drones rush around
tending to the various spacecraft. Four wide archways provide access to the promenades on this level, and at the center of the room, a small carpeted
platform leads down to the main level of the spaceport.

 [Alliance High Guard Command; Starship Store]
 This lavishly decorated store is probably the brightest and cheeriest on the level. Helpful salesdroids roll about from place to place, greeting new
customers as they enter and wishing them a good day as they leave. Large pedistals take up most of the available floorspace, each with a scale model
starship perched atop. Embedded into each of the pedistals is a computer with information on the ship classes scrolling on it. Beneath each computer
is a series of buttons, each clearly labeled as to their function. The button furthest to the left reads MENU, next to it is INFO, POINTS comes next,
and last is BUY. A small machine in one corner of the shop proclaims that it manipulates keys. Three buttons are on the front of this machine beneath
a narrow slot. Under the buttons is a much larger slot. The buttons read MAKE, DUPLICATE and INVALIDATE. To either side of the doorway are a pair of
guards that appear to be deep in conversation about various pros and cons of each starship class. An ornate archway leads to another room, and hung
above it is a sign with bold lettering proclaiming it to be a starship registry.
 You can go south.

 ["Golactic Money Maker" Control Room]
 The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the
front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches,
and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together
creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead
indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Gamma.

 The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the
front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches,
and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together
creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead
