 ["Golactic Invader" Engineering Room] (lying on the floor)
 Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row
of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, though it contains no information of value in its unpowered state.
The room is eerily silent without any of the ship's systems being powered. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a polished hardwood
floor. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking
through the window, you see the ship is at Outreach; Starship Garage.

near the ceiling. Recharging platforms create a maze of twisting pathways and dead end corridors throughout the garage, and silvery drones rush around
tending to the various spacecraft. Four wide archways provide access to the promenades on this level, and at the center of the room, a small carpeted
