 ["Golactic Invader" Control Room] (buckled into a velvet-covered cherrywood captain's chair)
 The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the
front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches,
and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has
been silenced by the lack of power, creating an eerie silence. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a polished hardwood floor.
There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through
the window, you see the ship is at Mercury; Surface Landing Site.
