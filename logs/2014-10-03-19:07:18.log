 [Varoshna; Interstellar Shipbuilding Corporation Central Spaceport; Landing Pad]
 This austere landing pad is quite enormous, given the general lack of traffic coming to and from the area. Made up of a smooth gray stone, the site
extends in a perfect square hundreds of meters across. There are high metal railings surrounding the pad, and beyond them, glimpses of tall pink
grasses can be seen. In the distant northwestern corner of the square, there is a small cylindrical stone structure cradled in the angle where the
railings meet. A set of sliding metal doors gleam brightly in its front.

 ["Golactic Invader" Control Room]
 The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the
front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches,
and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together
creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet,
covering the expanse of the room, is a polished hardwood floor. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. Looking through the
window, you see the ship is in space.
