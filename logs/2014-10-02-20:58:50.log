 [Outreach; Starship Garage]
 This enormous, dimly-lit room contains hundreds of sleeping giants. Their hulls gleam at the slightest light, freshly cleaned by the automatic
cleaning arms that moved from ship to ship. Every once in a while, one will be seized by mechanical arms and brought up to the landing pad, flooding
the room with light for a few moments. Several terminals stand idle, displaying a list of starships stored here.

 Little damage has been done to this large room. A row of cracked leather chairs has been bolted to the floor in front of an enormous black screen
with a row of buttons beneath it. A large sign, obviously much newer than the ship itself, has been taped just below the buttons. There is no
decoration in this stark room, save for the thin layer of dust coating every surface.
 You see a sign taped to the button board and Cue the droid here.

 [Alliance High Guard Command; Garage]
 This cavernous starship garage echoes with the sound of metal upon metal as starships are constantly transported to and from one of the four docking
bays. Narrow metal staircases wend their way up the sides of the dome to catwalks which provide access to those starships kept in long-term storage
near the ceiling. Recharging platforms create a maze of twisting pathways and dead end corridors throughout the garage, and silvery drones rush around
tending to the various spacecraft. Four wide archways provide access to the promenades on this level, and at the center of the room, a small carpeted
platform leads down to the main level of the spaceport.
 You see a group of unpowered ships here.

 ["Golactic Speedy" Control Room]
 The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the
front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches,
and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has
been silenced by the lack of power, creating an eerie silence. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly
enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.
 You can go south and out.
