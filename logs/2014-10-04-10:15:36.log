 [Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Beta]
 Situated on the uppermost level of the spaceport, this enormous docking bay is open to the sky above. A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the
entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols
between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the west looms the enormous gleaming steel
dome of the starship garage. An enormous letter B has been painted on its eastern face. Wide walkways slant off to the northwest and southwest. An
open doorway leads into an enormous steel building to the east.
 You see the four-person roborant "Hokus Pokus", the eight-person gunship "Blitzkrieg", the eight-person gunship "Asgard Defence 103", the
eight-person gunship "Rebellion", and the one-person expediter "Venturing" landed here.
 You see Jeffery the droid, Bee the droid, Brita the droid, Bodil the droid, Baba the droid, and Cassy the droid here.
 You can go northwest, east, and southwest.

 ["Golactic Invader" Control Room] (lying on the floor)
 The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the
front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches,
and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together
creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet,
covering the expanse of the room, is a polished hardwood floor. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. Looking through the
window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Beta.
 You see a group of miscellaneous objects here.
 You see Leon Westen (lying on a tall black co-captain's chair) here, sleeping.
 You can go south, down, and out.
