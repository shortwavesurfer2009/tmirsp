DESCRIPTION:
This sound pack has been created for the game Miriani. It's origins are in the VIPMUD sound pack for Windows based operating systems. I have attempted to duplicate as much of the VIPMUD sound pack onto the Linux operating system. I plan to sometime in the future test it on MacOS and make sure it works there as well.

KNOWN ISSUES

NOTES

the variable "os" stands for "output silencer"

the variable "vol" stands for "volume"

on ubuntu mplayer might be already installed. You may have to uninstall it and reinstall it for it to work properly.
uninstall: sudo apt-get purge mplayer
reinstall: sudo apt-get install mplayer
